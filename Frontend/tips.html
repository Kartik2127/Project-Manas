    <h1>General Tips to Live a Healthy, Peaceful Life</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Simple daily habits that help you stay emotionally strong, mentally clear, and physically relaxed.</p>

    <div class="tips-container">

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Meditate for 10 Minutes Daily</h3>
        <p>Meditation helps calm the nervous system, reduces stress hormones, and improves emotional balance. Just 10 minutes a day can change your mental clarity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Read Something Calming</h3>
        <p>Spend a few minutes reading something peaceful—stories, poems, or uplifting thoughts. It helps your mind slow down and release tension.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Take Mindful Walks in Nature</h3>
        <p>Walking outside boosts mood, reduces anxiety, and helps reset your thoughts. Even a 10–15 minute walk can make a huge difference.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Practice Gratitude Before Sleep</h3>
        <p>Thinking of 2–3 things you're grateful for at the end of the day improves sleep quality and strengthens positive thinking patterns.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Stay Hydrated Throughout the Day</h3>
        <p>Water affects your mood, concentration, and energy levels. Drink 6–8 glasses daily to keep your mind active and body refreshed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Reduce Screen Time Before Bed</h3>
        <p>Avoid phones or laptops 30 minutes before sleep. Blue light disrupts melatonin and increases anxiety at night.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Do Deep Breathing Exercises</h3>
        <p>Take slow, controlled breaths—inhale 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds. This instantly relaxes your brain and body.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Stay Connected With People You Trust</h3>
        <p>Talk regularly to a friend, mentor, or family member. Even short conversations help reduce emotional burden and loneliness.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Organize Your Room</h3>
        <p>A tidy space clears your mind. Cleaning even one small area improves focus and reduces stress.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h3>Take Breaks Between Study Sessions</h3>
        <p>Use the 50–10 rule: study/work 50 minutes, rest 10. This prevents burnout and boosts productivity.</p>
