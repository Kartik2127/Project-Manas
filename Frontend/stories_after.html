          When I first came to college, everything felt overwhelming. I thought I was the only one struggling. 
          Then I found Manas. Sharing what I felt anonymously made me realize I wasn’t alone, and that was the 
          beginning of my healing.

            Speaking anonymously helped me talk about things I had been bottling up for months.
